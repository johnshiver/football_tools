### CALCULATE PLAYER SCORE ###

What to include?

last years point total
weight the last 8 games slightly for this total (1.1) (worth tweaking this)

# somehow normalize for TD points, they require a bit of luck / greatly increase point totals
# (think, critical hit % that can be highly variable) i think i care more about
# this for wr / te / rb than qb
# prefer players who have proven they can score tds, but get efficient
# production


pnt production variance: give slight weight to lower standard deviation for pnts / game (see what this is!)
injury: give deduction for injury (injury status should be on gradient 1-3 perhaps)
age: give bump or deduction for age (depending on position)
   rb: under 27, bump; over 27 deduction, over 30, significant deduction
   wr: under 24, slight deduction, 24-31 slight bump, over 31 deduction, over 34, significant deduction
   qb: under 25, slight deduction.  25-35 slight bump, over 35 deduction
   te: for now, same as

strength of schedule: ignore because i dont think you'll know how strong
                      schedule actually is until the season starts

bye weeks: going to ignore, id rather lose 1 week than lose out on
           players i want for a whole season.  will re-visit this
           next year


### COMMANDS ####

create_draft

  enter teams: (space deliminted; store in an array for now...maybe periodically save the teams to disk)
  enter keepers: (loop over teams, ask for inputs.  do a fuzzy search on player name and confirm player.
                  if for some reason the player isnt in the database, enter in position + name as place holder)

  ### idea: do i need to worry about other teams to write an optimal algorithm?
      i.e. is a player's value affected by what other teams COULD choose
      the answer is clearly yes, but the question is how big is the difference


 # menu while waiting to enter a pick
 1. display team roster (take input)
 2. display my roster
 3. display top available picks
 4. make pick (takes team + player)
 5. delete pick (takes team, then lets you select player. should update status)


show_top_players
  takes optional input (rb / wr / qb / te / def)
  otherwise just displays top 10 available players by

reset_player_draft_status
  in current draft, players should be marked as available / unavailable
  this will make everyone available

mark_injuries

reset_injuries
